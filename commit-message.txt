feat: Apply all 8 improvements to docker-compose configuration (Story 4-2)

DEVIATION FIX (1):
- Fix: Correct PostgreSQL health check interval from 5s to 10s
  * Aligns with acceptance criteria AC #1
  * Reduces health check overhead (50s max wait = 5 retries × 10s)

ENHANCEMENTS (3):
- Add: Liquibase restart policy (on-failure)
  * Auto-retry on transient database connection failures
  * Won't restart on successful completion (exit code 0)
  
- Verify: Volume driver explicit declaration (already present)
  * Confirms local volume storage for PostgreSQL data persistence
  
- Verify: Network driver explicit declaration (already present)
  * Confirms bridge network for inter-service communication

OPTIMIZATIONS (4):
- Add: PostgreSQL resource limits
  * CPU: 1.0 limit, 0.5 reservation
  * Memory: 512M limit, 256M reservation
  * Prevents resource exhaustion, guarantees minimum allocation
  
- Add: Application resource limits
  * CPU: 2.0 limit, 1.0 reservation
  * Memory: 1G limit, 512M reservation
  * Controls JVM resource usage, aligns with MaxRAMPercentage=75%
  
- Add: Application health check
  * Endpoint: /actuator/health
  * Interval: 30s, Timeout: 10s, Retries: 3
  * Start period: 60s (allows Spring Boot initialization)
  * Enables automatic health monitoring and restart capability
  
- Add: Logging configuration for all services
  * Driver: json-file
  * Max size: 10MB per file
  * Max files: 3 (30MB total per service, ~90MB for all)
  * Automatic log rotation prevents disk space issues

IMPACT:
✅ Reliability: Auto-retry on failures + health monitoring
✅ Performance: Resource guarantees prevent starvation
✅ Operations: Log rotation prevents disk fill
✅ Production Ready: Industry best practices applied

TESTING:
- Configuration validated: docker compose config (passed)
- Ready for end-to-end testing: docker compose up --build
- Health checks properly configured for all services

FILES CHANGED:
- docker-compose.yml (modified: +41 lines, -1 line)
- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-2-IMPROVEMENTS-APPLIED.md (new)
- _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4-2-QUICK-REFERENCE.md (new)
